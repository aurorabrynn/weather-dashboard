# Weather Dashboard

## Description
I created a weather dashboard. Weather is important to know when you're travelling; planes can be delayed, bad driving conditions can cause accidents, camping trips can be ruined, etc. Having an easy to access forecast can be very helpful in preparing for your trip so that you can enjoy yourself even when it's raining.

I solidified many ideas about JavaScript and fucntions, and learned how to access APIs effectively.
